1 dimensional histograms
run like 10 times each
plot constituient features (pt, y, phi)
turn y into bits
inference time
storage
jet-level histograms of jet mass
plot float 64 vs float 16 vs 32 and file size
try with top-tagging

classifier to tell if float16/32 or float64

"transforming jet flavor tagging at atlas"
- Could take their samples, make the same change, replicate their transformer results, much more interesting
    - Easiest place for full scale example
    - Could also do internally on CMS
        -  Root trees
